### Topic:
```
 Cities have issues of safety. There is data available in cities, which indicates a particular 
 section being more unsafe than others. What should be done with these unsafe parts of any city 
 to increase the safety of our citizens?

```


### Problem Statement Number: BC74

### Domain

```
Software - Web application
```


### Proposed Solution
```
The purpose of our web application is to keep our citizens safe.
It'll give the user a heads up about all the unsafe locations nearby which 
can be viewed directly on a map in a user-friendly format (icons which represent a particular incident).
It'll inform the user about the various kinds of crimes/incidents 
that has happened near the user's location. 

There will be an admin panel which will be used to monitor the incidents reported
by the users and hence mark safe or unsafe territories on the map. To prevent spamming,
only the admin is allowed to mark the incidents on the map.


The application also houses an SOS/panic button which enables the user
to alert the local authorities with his/her location in case the user finds himself/herself 
in any sort of danger.
Thus providing a complete solution to make the citizens feel safe in their neighborhood.
